**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application that clones the  website.
-   **Frontend:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS. It features a homepage, product pages, collection pages, a checkout page with payment options UI, and cart functionality. A comprehensive admin panel UI has been created.
-   **Backend:** A FastAPI server connected to a MongoDB database. It includes API endpoints for admin authentication, products, orders, customers, and site settings.
-   **Data:** The frontend is primarily powered by mock data located in . Backend integration is pending.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was addressing two user requests simultaneously:
    1.  Fixing the category navigation buttons (her, him, kids) on the homepage, which were not navigating to the correct pages.
    2.  Changing the website's color scheme to a lite blue shade.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The test should verify that the category buttons navigate correctly and that the new light blue color scheme is applied consistently across all pages. A screenshot tool should also be used for visual confirmation.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0):** Category navigation buttons on the homepage are not working.
-   **Issue 2 (P1):** The site-wide color scheme change to a lite blue shade is incomplete.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent identified that the  component was only updating its internal state instead of triggering navigation. A file write was performed to modify .
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify that the updated  now uses React Router's  component or the  hook to handle navigation.
        2.  Test each category button on the homepage to confirm it redirects to the correct URL (e.g., ).
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical bug fix. Fixing it will restore core user navigation for browsing product categories.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
-   **Issue 2:**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent began applying the new color scheme by updating , , , and .
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  The agent noted it needs to update the remaining files. Systematically review all major components and pages (e.g., , , , ) and apply the light blue theme.
        2.  Use the screenshot tool to verify color consistency on all key pages.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This fulfills a direct user request to change the website's visual design.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete and Verify UI Fixes**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has written the first batch of files for the color and navigation fixes. The immediate next step is to continue updating the remaining frontend components to the light blue theme and then test both the navigation and the color changes thoroughly.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The website will be fully functional as per the latest user requests, with working category navigation and a consistent new color scheme.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **P0: Full Backend Integration:** Replace all mock data in  with live API calls. Implement the backend logic for all CRUD operations initiated from the admin panel (for Products, Orders, Customers, etc.).
-   **P1: User Authentication & Dashboard:** Implement user registration/login and create the user-facing dashboard for viewing order history.
-   **P2: Payment Gateway Integration:** Implement the backend logic for Razorpay and Stripe, using API keys configured in the admin panel. This includes handling payment webhooks and updating order statuses.
-   **P3: Order and Notification System:** Build out the complete order lifecycle and set up automatic email notifications for order confirmation and status updates.
-   **P4: Complete Admin Panel Functionality:** Implement user management (block/edit), refund management, and the support ticket system.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **Database:** MongoDB (using  async driver)
-   **State Management:** React Context API for the shopping cart.

**key DB schema**
-   Pydantic models in  imply the following MongoDB collections:
    -   : For admin credentials.
    -   : For product information.
    -   : For customer orders.
    -   : For customer data.
    -   : For dynamic site configuration from the admin panel.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Modified to fix navigation. Needs verification.
-    & : Modified to apply the new color theme and other custom styles.
-   : Contains the UI for the entire admin panel.
-   : Contains the UI for the checkout flow.
-   : The single file containing all backend logic, API endpoints, and database models.
-   : The source of all product data currently displayed on the frontend.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The frontend's dependence on  must be refactored to use API calls to the backend.
-   The  file is monolithic and should be broken down into smaller, more manageable components for each admin section (e.g., Dashboard, Orders, Products).

**key api endpoints**
-   : (POST) Creates the initial admin user.
-   : (POST) Authenticates an admin user.
-   : (GET) Fetches all products.
-   : (GET) Fetches all orders.
-   : (GET/POST) Manages site configuration.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The immediate priority is to finish and verify the two UI fixes: fixing category navigation and completing the color scheme change.
-   The most significant upcoming task is the full backend integration. The entire frontend is currently running on mock data.
-   The user has high expectations for the admin panel, wanting it to control nearly every aspect of the site's content and configuration. The UI is built, but the backend logic is pending.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   **1. User:** Call Deployer Agent and Run Health Check to Check for Readiness for Deployment - Status: COMPLETED.
-   **2. User:** I check frontend there her him kids all buttons not working and change frond colour to lite blue shade - Status: IN PROGRESS. This is the current highest-priority task.
-   **3. User:** (Paraphrased) The admin panel needs to control everything: images, text, logo, payment methods, customer data, and send automatic emails. - Status: ACKNOWLEDGED, planned for future tasks.
-   **4. User:** (Paraphrased) Go to the next step, remove Made with Emergent, and add payment methods UI for UPI, Razorpay, and Stripe. - Status: COMPLETED (UI part is done, logic is pending).
-   **5. User:** thenamestrings.in this url and paper clone this and api this time you use domies and after we are change this using admin panel - Status: ACKNOWLEDGED, this guided the initial development.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working:** Frontend rendering, backend server, database service.
-   **Broken:** Category navigation from the homepage is non-functional.
-   **Mocked:** All frontend data (products, categories), all admin panel functionality, and all payment methods are UI-only without backend logic.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Planned:**
    -   Razorpay (Payments) — requires User API Key
    -   Stripe (Payments) — requires User API Key

-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** The category navigation on the homepage is broken.
